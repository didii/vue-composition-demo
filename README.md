# composition-demo

This is a small demo showcasing the use of the composition API.
You can also use it as an exercise if you'd like to try and fill in the gaps.

The demo is a folder manager with a couple of features:

* Folder management
  * Creating a file
  * Deleting a file
  * Deleting a folder
* File and folder search
* Saving the data locally

The `master` branch (this branch) has code to prepare for the demo.
The branch `finished` has the code after the demo was finished.
